# Repository Planning & Open Source Collaboration
## 仓库规划与开源协作

I have given this repository a great deal of thought, as converting it into a full - stack project later on would involve the matter of varieties of project certifications, some of which can explode huge copyright issues. Out of respect for all the respectable GitHub open - source developers, the full - stack project will not be released as public repository without prior coordination.

Given the scale of the GitHub platform, this repo I think would be a massive undertaking. Therefore, I, AlexBybye, **welcome all like - minded individuals** to participate in the sharing and compilation of resource code and information.

Currently, due to the approaching end of the semester, this repository is only in the design framework stage.

The front - end portion of this project is planned to begin in late June.

I simply aim to contribute my modest efforts to enhancing the user experience through this project. As *Newton once said, “I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea - shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”*

I also hope that one day, I can become one of the programmers of high - quality projects, whether or not this project is listed.
